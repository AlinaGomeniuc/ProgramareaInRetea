## Laboratory work nr.1
The main task is to traverse links obtained from a docker server in order to save all the data from there. Once done, all the data should be converted to the same format. After that, it is required to create a multiple client server such that, all the clients will be able to request information from the server and get an response. The information that is stored on the local server is the one collected from the docker server.

### 1. Traverse the links
For the first part, we should access the root route. In order to traverse all the links present on the server, we should register using an Access-Token. It can be obtained from the ***/register*** link.
